# Dev_Setup
Setup Development Environment

#Assignment: Setting Up Your Developer Environment

#Objective:
This assignment aims to familiarize you with the tools and configurations necessary to set up an efficient developer environment for software engineering projects. Completing this assignment will give you the skills required to set up a robust and productive workspace conducive to coding, debugging, version control, and collaboration.

#Tasks:

1. Select Your Operating System (OS):
   Choose an operating system that best suits your preferences and project requirements. Download and Install Windows 11. https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows11

2. Install a Text Editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE):
   Select and install a text editor or IDE suitable for your programming languages and workflow. Download and Install Visual Studio Code. https://code.visualstudio.com/Download
3. Set Up Version Control System:
   Install Git and configure it on your local machine. Create a GitHub account for hosting your repositories. Initialize a Git repository for your project and make your first commit. https://github.com

4. Install Necessary Programming Languages and Runtimes:
  Instal Python from http://wwww.python.org programming language required for your project and install their respective compilers, interpreters, or runtimes. Ensure you have the necessary tools to build and execute your code.

5. Install Package Managers:
   If applicable, install package managers like pip (Python).

6. Configure a Database (MySQL):
   Download and install MySQL database. https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/installer/5.7.html

7. Set Up Development Environments and Virtualization (Optional):
   Consider using virtualization tools like Docker or virtual machines to isolate project dependencies and ensure consistent environments across different machines.

8. Explore Extensions and Plugins:
   Explore available extensions, plugins, and add-ons for your chosen text editor or IDE to enhance functionality, such as syntax highlighting, linting, code formatting, and version control integration.

9. Document Your Setup:
    Create a comprehensive document outlining the steps you've taken to set up your developer environment. Include any configurations, customizations, or troubleshooting steps encountered during the process. 

#Deliverables:
- Document detailing the setup process with step-by-step instructions and screenshots where necessary.
- A GitHub repository containing a sample project initialized with Git and any necessary configuration files (e.g., .gitignore).
- A reflection on the challenges faced during setup and strategies employed to overcome them.

#Submission:
Submit your document and GitHub repository link through the designated platform or email to the instructor by the specified deadline.

#Evaluation Criteria:**
- Completeness and accuracy of setup documentation.
- Effectiveness of version control implementation.
- Appropriateness of tools selected for the project requirements.
- Clarity of reflection on challenges and solutions encountered.
- Adherence to submission guidelines and deadlines.

Note: Feel free to reach out for clarification or assistance with any aspect of the assignment.





       NAME: Ajiboye Oluwatobi Samuel
Assignment: Setting Up Your Developer Environment
Step 1. I selected windows operating system 10 which is the default of my machine as my laptop is unable to install windows operating system 11 as it does not meet the requirements.
 
 





Step 2. I installed visual studio code as IDE by accessing the link of the official website via google the link and following the steps as showed by the instructor in the live class. After onboarding, I installed extensions like python, data wrangler, code runner, jupyter, git, pylance.
 
Step 3:  I used the link and installed Git bash on my machine, I assigned a mail and username using git bash and after assigning, I went to the github website, created account using same email and username previously assigned and after the successful creation of the account, I navigated back to git bash and I created a directory using the commands given by the instructor; mkdir(name), cd(name) and the file was created in my computer.
I enter the command git init into gitbash to initialize then I check the git status.
I located the created file in my pc and create a text document in the folder and press git status to check. I press git add (name).txt then I commit the file by using git commit with a message. I checked on git hub command line, added origin an pushed the file.
In order to link the created file on github to git I input Vi README.md, I press I to insert and insert what I want, I press escape button, shift:, press W, Q and enter.
I press git add to add everything then I commit with a message. I press git fetch to fetch, git pull, and my IDE opens and I inputted a message and saved. Then I pressed git push.
 

Step 4: I installed python programming language 3.1.2 from the official python website. I also confirmed the correct version was installed after installation.
 
Step 5: I installed mysql from the link and I set up the database after installation following the steps from the instructor dave.

 



NOTE; I faced no challenges during the setup processes.
